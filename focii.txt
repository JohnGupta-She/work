Preface: I touched grass this break (Let's Goooooo!)
Another Preface: I am now 17. I would be excited for this, but I feel too old and sad now. It occurred to me on my birthday (24th) that high school is a real growing period for kids: you enter a snot-nosed kid of 14 and leave a full adult of 18 (for early-borns like me).

I quickly realized the author's point was not only valid and required more thought, but extremely relevant to me specifically, as my first reaction was to click off and watch youtube (I heeded this reaction after a short period of reading).
In proper Stuy fashion, the first I had looked at it was Friday, and immediately, I clicked off to watch youtube. Nearly the end of the day already, I had decided to let the matter rest.
The next day, I woke up to a math competition, (parentals) drove to Boston (Cambridge) to meet my sister, cs competition, spent time with sistor, drove back, and here I am, 10:53, Sunday, writing this up.
Feeling guilty, perhaps rightfully so (probably), I decided to at least sneak a peak at the results of this fellow human's dive into the unknown, and was pretty confident in my prediction that he would find good results, especially for 3 days time.
Of course, I was right: he said that his attention span had increased significantly, but there were two things that really surprised me:
1. he didn't really crave to do the internet tings, after all.
2. he found a good way to find information without the internet tings through the mean of crowdsourcing (getting the forecast from his mom and such)
These 3 things in total really made me interested in this for myself, but who knows if I will actually have the attention span and self control to pull such a feat off. I mean... 3 whole days without the internet? Give me a break...
