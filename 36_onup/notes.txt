HW36 -- All Quacked Up
time spent: 

NOTES D.1 Compile-Time Errors:

- fix errors one at a time and then recompile
- only look at the first error message, it is the only one that is truly reliable
- pay attention to what the error message says
- if there is no apparent error exactly where the compiler points to, search other places, typically slightly before

Syntax errors to check for:

- parens
- upper != lower letters
- ; placement
- quotation rules ("" for string, '' for char)
- matching data types (assignment, inputs and outputs)
- calling methods from outside the class (use .)
- static & non-static

If you are way off course:

- make copy of file
- delete half of it
- check compilability
- narrow down search

^ also the optimal way to win "Guess Who" by Mark Rober: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRlbNOno5VA

Important note: the compiler is not always right in its suggestions of debugging, it is just a tool to use as evidence

NOTES D.2 Run-Time Errors:

Hanging:

- likely caused by an infinite loop or recursion
- add print statements as diagnostics to test what is wrong
- fix as necessary (use visualizer or trace it on paper if necessary)

Important note: don't add too many print statements, or you will get flooded with output
		if your print statements aren't working, try using println instead of print

NOTES D.3 Logic Errors:

- if your program isn't working correctly, run a few test cases and hypothesize what is going wrong
- use the visualizer and trace to gain insight into what your code is doing
- using print statements are good here too

IF YOU ARE STUCK:
take a break away from the computer for a bit, come back fresh

IF THAT DID NOT WORK:
consult help in the form of rubber duckie or some gud fam
