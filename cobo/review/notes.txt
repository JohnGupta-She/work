DISCO:
 - the csv file doesn't have enough words donde esta "hate" or "love" those are very essential to reviews

QCC:
 - Are we supposed to do activity 5
 - Would add headings to the reviews and adj list files but that would mess it all up...unless theres a way to ignore lines in txt files?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Answers to things~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Activity 1

1. a) sentimentVal( String )
   b) It requires a String anything else will return a 0
   c) It returns a double

2. sentimentVal("accused");   -> -1.5
   sentimentVal("murder");    -> -1.93
   sentimentVal("frigid");    -> 0.31

3. a) It compiles. You are storing a double val in a double type var.
   b) It won't compile. You can't store doubles in Strings.
   c) It won't compile. The method only takes one parameter.

Activity 2

4. The method first takes in a txt file and turns it into a giant String and splits it into separate words
   by whitespace and stores it into an array. It then iterates through this array and adds up the total sentiment
   vals for each word and returns that sum.

5. a) The ratings do not make sense because the csv file is lack critical words and their sentiment values such as
      "kill" and "hate". It also seems to not be able to words in all tenses, only specific ones.
   b) Add more words and tenses. Interpret expressions with contractions and other punctuation marks.

6. He is doing it all backwards. The logic operator should be ">". Zero is less than 15 meaning in his code it'd
   get 4 stars when it should be 0 stars.

Activity 3

3. The indexOf methods return the index within a string of the first occurance of the specificied substring.
   The substring methods return a new string with a substring starting from sepecified indexes. You can use this
   by finding the indexes of every " " and substringing everything between these indexes. It is necessary to add
   a zero because of indexing.

5. static methods can't access non static methods. The main method is static, it can't access any non static methods.

6. First you'd have to assign sentiment values to the adjectives. Then program it to search through the csv list to see whether or not the adj is a
   good or bad thing (pos or neg). Depending on what it is, get a random adj from the corresponding list.
   If asking for just creating a fake pos or neg review regardless of the og adj then just only access that adjective list

Activity 4

1. To troll someone

2. You're selling something on Amazon and so fake good 5 star reviews

3. Just do everything it already does but also make it take in another parameter. If you specify you want a pos review then the program will only take
   adjectives from the posadj list.

5. It wouldn't work because oneWord isn't a String. If it is a String var then it would return all the characters after the first character at index 0.

6. Because the words in the csv file don't start with * so you won't be able to find them.

7. Make it only pick adjectives with a sentiment value of over 1
